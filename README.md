Authored by Devin Weaver ([@sukima][]).

The strings in this script were created and published by [Franklin
(tacit)][tacit] in his blog post. It's popularity gained enough significance to
make to my twitter feed. I use [Campfire][] with my partners to help bridge the
gap we have while we are off at work. Included is our own [Hubot][] who keeps
the chat room fun and unique. I felt such a script would be very useful as
frequent reminders we all could use in our pursuit of developing good relations
with the people we love.
